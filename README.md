# AI-Survey-Survey-Monkey-challenge
This is the first place winning project that my team, the Opinionated Orangutans made for the Survey Monkey Challenge

It may not work without the API keys however, but the javaScript files shows the concept we were going for.

Used OpenAI's API in conjunction with Survey Monkey's API to pull user and post meta data and automatically make and display a Survey Monkey survey, custom tailored to that post and the user.
